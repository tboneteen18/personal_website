  <h4>
    the tournament link will take you to my swiss tournament generator. <br>
    this will randomly generate 16 user with first and last names and matche them up with eachother. <br>
    each of the 16 players total wins and losses are stored per round and they are matched up with people with similar scores. <br>
    I had a lot of fun making this and I hope you enjoy it.
